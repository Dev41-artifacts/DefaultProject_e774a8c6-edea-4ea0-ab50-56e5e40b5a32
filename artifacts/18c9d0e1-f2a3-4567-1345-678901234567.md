# Technical Design Document for E-commerce Website Proof of Concept (POC)

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the technical design for a proof of concept e-commerce website intended to connect pet owners with limited time and their pets for playdates. The goal is to create an interactive platform where pets can also find matches (playdates) through a user-friendly interface. This project targets metropolitan areas and incorporates user engagement metrics to assess its success.

## 2. System Design
### 2.1 Architecture Overview
The architecture of the system will follow a microservices approach to ensure scalability and maintainability. Key components include:
- **Frontend**: A minimalistic user interface developed using React.js for responsiveness and easy navigation.
- **Backend**: APIs developed with Node.js and Express to handle user interactions, session management, and other functionalities.
- **Database**: SQL database (MySQL or PostgreSQL) to manage user data, sessions, and interactions.

### 2.2 Component Interactions
1. **User Interaction**: Users will authenticate and navigate the platform. Events trigger API calls for playdates.
2. **Session Management**: APIs for managing user sessions will be integrated to ensure secure and efficient data handling.
3. **Matching Algorithm**: A service to match pets based on user-defined preferences and location.

### 2.3 API Specifications
- **User Authentication API**: Handles registration and login for pet owners. Security considerations include password hashing and secure token delivery.
- **Session Handling API**: Manages user sessions and interactions. APIs can be commented out during specific test sessions.
- **Playdate Matching API**: Fetches potential matches based on location and user preferences.

## 3. Implementation Details
### 3.1 Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js, HTML5, CSS3
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MySQL/PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)

### 3.2 SQL Schema Design
- **Users Table**: Stores user details including name, email, password hash, and location.
  - `user_id (PRIMARY KEY)`
  - `username VARCHAR`
  - `email VARCHAR`
  - `password_hash VARCHAR`
  - `location VARCHAR`

- **Pets Table**: Stores pet details linked to the user.
  - `pet_id (PRIMARY KEY)`
  - `user_id (FOREIGN KEY)`
  - `pet_name VARCHAR`
  - `pet_breed VARCHAR`
  - `pet_age INT`

- **Playdates Table**: Simulates playdate events between pets.
  - `playdate_id (PRIMARY KEY)`
  - `pet_id_1 (FOREIGN KEY)`
  - `pet_id_2 (FOREIGN KEY)`
  - `date_time DATETIME`

## 4. Technical Constraints
- **Compliance**: The product must achieve certification with beta standards for user engagement and data handling.
- **Security**: Ensure user data is securely handled and authenticated using industry standards.

## 5. Testing Approaches
1. **Unit Testing**: Each component will be unit tested during development to ensure functionality.
2. **Integration Testing**: Test interactions between components continuously.
3. **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**: Engage target users for feedback on usability and functionality.

## 6. Deployment Considerations
- **Hosting**: Consider AWS or Heroku for hosting the application, ensuring it can scale according to user engagement.
- **Monitoring**: Integrate monitoring solutions for performance and error tracking.
- **Rollout**: Plan for staged rollouts to mitigate risks and address user feedback efficiently.

## 7. Conclusion
This document provides a comprehensive technical overview for the e-commerce website proof of concept. By focusing on user engagement and secure interactions, the project aims to create a robust platform for pet owners and children to coordinate playdates, enhancing the quality of pet ownership in metropolitan environments.

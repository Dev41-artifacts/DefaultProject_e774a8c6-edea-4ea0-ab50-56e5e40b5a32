# Architecture Overview for E-commerce Platform

The architecture includes several components to support user interactions, API management, session handling, and secure user authentication. It focuses on a minimalistic user interface that enhances navigation and engagement for both pet owners and children.

## Components

1. **User Interface (UI)**
   - **Web Frontend**: User-friendly interface for pet owners and children to interact with the platform.
   - **Technologies**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React.js for dynamic content).

2. **API Gateway**
   - Central point for all API calls; allows for session-based management of API endpoints.
   - Responsible for routing requests to the appropriate services.

3. **User Management Service**
   - Handles user authentication and profile management.
   - Ensures secure login/logout mechanisms.
   - **Data Storage**: User profiles (SQL database).

4. **Session Management Service**
   - Manages user sessions, providing the ability to comment out API interactions based on session data.
   - Ensures effective tracking of user activities.

5. **Playdate Matching Algorithm**
   - Processes market interactions and matches pets for playdates based on preferences and availability.
   - Uses user data from the User Management Service to enhance matching accuracy.

6. **Database**
   - Centralized SQL schema designed to store user data, petsâ€™ details, interaction history, and session logs.
   - Tables could include: `users`, `pets`, `playdates`, `interactions`, and `sessions`.

7. **Feedback & Analytics Module**
   - Tracks user engagement and success metrics (e.g., number of matches). 
   - Integration with analytics tools for generating reports.

## Data Flow

1. **User Action**: The user performs an action (e.g., searching for potential playdates).
2. **API Call**: An API call is triggered to the API Gateway.
3. **Session Management**: The appropriate session is checked, possibly commenting out specific API calls based on user actions.
4. **Matching Process**: The Playdate Matching Algorithm processes data from the user and presents potential matches.
5. **User Interaction**: Users can swipe left or right to accept or decline the proposed playdates.

## Technical Stack Considerations

- **Frontend**: React.js for a dynamic user interface.
- **Backend**: Node.js for handling requests and business logic.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL or MySQL for relational data storage.
- **Hosting**: Cloud services (AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure) for scalability.
- **Compliance**: Ensure beta certification by adhering to relevant standards and best practices.

## SQL Schema Design (Conceptual)

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE pets (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT REFERENCES users(id),
    name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    breed VARCHAR(50),
    age INT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE playdates (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    pet1_id INT REFERENCES pets(id),
    pet2_id INT REFERENCES pets(id),
    date_created TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    matched BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
);

CREATE TABLE sessions (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT REFERENCES users(id),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE
);
```

## Success Metrics

- **Engagement**: Track user interactions to measure the frequency and quality of playdate matches.
- **Beta Compliance**: Ensure all features meet beta testing standards before launch.
- **User Satisfaction**: Gather feedback from users to improve the platform continuously.

This structured architecture enables scalability, security, and a focused user experience targeted at pet owners and their children in urban settings.

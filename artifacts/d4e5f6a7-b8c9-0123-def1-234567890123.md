# E-Commerce Proof of Concept Architecture

## Overview
This document provides a detailed description of the architecture for an e-commerce proof of concept (POC) platform aimed at connecting pet owners and children for playdates. The architecture includes various system components, their interactions, data flows, and a proposed technical stack.

## System Components

1. **User Interface (UI)**  
   - A minimalistic web interface tailored for ease of navigation.  
   - Features: User authentication, pet profiles, playdate scheduling, and interaction notifications.  

2. **API Gateway**  
   - Manages incoming requests from the UI.  
   - Routes requests to appropriate backend services.  
   - Can dynamically comment out API endpoints for specific sessions.

3. **User Authentication Service**  
   - Handles user registration and login, ensuring secure access for pet owners.  
   - Implements JWT tokens for session management.

4. **Session Management Service**  
   - Responsible for tracking active sessions and managing playdate interactions.
   - Integrates with the API to process user actions, such as scheduling playdates.

5. **Database**  
   - **SQL Schema**  
       - Users (id, username, password, pet_details, location)
       - Sessions (id, user_id, start_time, end_time)
       - PlayDates (id, pet_owner_id, pet_id, playdate_time, location, status)

6. **Notification Service**  
   - Sends alerts for playdate notifications and interactions.
   - Can integrate with a messaging service for real-time alerts.

7. **Analytics Service**  
   - Gathers and analyzes data to measure user engagement and matches.  
   - Provides insights to ensure the product meets beta compliance standards.

## Data Flow  
1. User visits the web interface and registers/signs in, triggering the User Authentication Service.  
2. Upon successful authentication, users can create and view pet profiles and playdate schedules.  
3. For each action, an API call to the respective backend service is triggered.  
4. User actions are processed via the API Gateway, which routes them to the Session Management and Notification Services.  
5. The Analytics Service collects data on user engagement and matches in real-time.

## Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: React for UI, Axios for API calls  
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express for server-side, PostgreSQL for SQL database  
- **Authentication**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for user sessions  
- **Deployment**: Docker containers orchestrated by Kubernetes  
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus and Grafana for observability and performance metrics  

## Success Metrics
- **User Engagement**: Measure user logins, profile completions, and active sessions.
- **Matches**: Evaluate the number of successful playdate arrangements.
- **Certification**: Achieve beta compliance standards for user engagement and data security.

## Conclusion
This architecture outlines the framework for building an efficient e-commerce POC aimed at pet owners, designed to facilitate playdates between pets and children in a user-friendly manner. Each component plays a critical role in ensuring the platform's goals are met while delivering a delightful experience for its users.
